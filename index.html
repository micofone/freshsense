      <h2>What Is FreshSense?</h2>
      <p>
        FreshSense is a simple hardware + software system that continuously monitors the air inside your mushroom farm.
        Our smart odor sensor detects unusual smell patterns linked to mold, bacteria, and other contamination—
        then sends clear alerts to your phone before problems spread.

    <div class="section-inner">
      <h2>Why Smell Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Contamination often shows up in smell before it appears on your blocks or shelves.
        By tracking air changes, FreshSense flags trouble early—giving you time to isolate the issue,
        adjust ventilation, or remove affected substrate before the damage spreads.

        <h2>About FreshSense</h2>
        <p>
          We’re a small team of engineers and mushroom growers who were tired of losing blocks
          to contamination we only noticed when it was already too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreshSense started as a side project in a single grow room and has grown into a
          dedicated tool for farms that want earlier warnings, calmer days, and more reliable harvests.
